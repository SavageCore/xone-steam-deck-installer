First time setting up your Deck? You may enjoy my [setup guide](https://gist.github.com/SavageCore/eeb8b6ba032c0865e5c2a9eb8e073ab5). It'll get you started on Emulation.

# Improvements üí™

Main changes at initial release versus [cdleveille's](https://gist.github.com/cdleveille/e84c235c6e8c17042d35a7c0d92cdc96) original script:
- Added zenity for a basic "GUI"
- Added sudo check
- Added various checks to prevent the script from redoing things that are already done
- Ensure the module is loaded after install and on boot
- Return `steamos-readonly` to its previous state after install

# Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

1. Switch to [Desktop mode](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/671A-4453-E8D2-323C)
2. Launch Konsole
3. Run `wget -O /tmp/bootstrap.sh https://github.com/SavageCore/xone-steam-deck-installer/releases/latest/download/bootstrap.sh && sh /tmp/bootstrap.sh`

‚ö†Ô∏è If you have problems during install please read this [pinned issue](https://github.com/SavageCore/xone-steam-deck-installer/issues/1).

## Pairing üë´

You can enable and disable pairing mode from the included Desktop shortcuts, saving you from getting up and pressing that button!

After installation you may need to restart your Deck to get things working. Failing that try shutting down and waiting a minute before starting up again. Using the Desktop shortcut or command to enable pairing can also get things working.

`echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/xone-dongle/*/pairing`
